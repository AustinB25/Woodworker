        <p> 
            With Covid-19 effecting our live so drastically last year, I had to come up with new ways to make money. 
            At the time I ran a remodeling business, and it only seemed fitting for me to get into woodworking.

        <h2>Effects of Covid</h2>
        <p>
            Due to me doing business in remodeling homes. Covid hit me especially hard. Even though Covid punched me in 
            places we won't talk about, I was able to bounce back with woodworking.
